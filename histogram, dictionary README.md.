Stores and updates counts using a dictionary

Finds the email address with the highest occurrence


Key Concepts Used

File handling (open, with)

String methods (startswith, split)

Dictionaries for counting occurrences

Loops and conditional logic

Purpose:

Parsing structured text files

Counting occurrences using dictionaries

Finding maximum values in a dataset
